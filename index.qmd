    I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University. I am fortunate to work with <a href="https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/svalliy" target="_blank">Dr. Sharma Thankachan</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research interests lie broadly in the field of Algorithms, with a particular focus on String and Graph algorithms. These areas fascinate me due to their fundamental importance in computer science and their wide-ranging applications in various disciplines.
